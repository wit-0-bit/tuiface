# Ideas

Unvetted brainstorm space — nothing here is decided, let alone promised.
When an idea gets the nod it graduates to [TODOs.md](TODOs.md); when it's
rejected it gets deleted (git history remembers). Proposals welcome — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what a good pitch includes.

## Complications

- Distance Walked
- UTC Offset (e.g. -07:00 or +08:00)
- Sunrise / Sunset Time (designed for wider top slots)
- Daily High / Low Temp (combined version for top slots, split individual
  versions for bottom slots)

## Interactions

> **Platform note (June 2026):** touchscreen interactions are off the table
> for watchfaces. PebbleOS reserves the touch sensor for watchapps — a
> watchface's `touch_service_subscribe()` silently no-ops (see
> `src/fw/applib/touch_service.c` in
> [coredevices/PebbleOS](https://github.com/coredevices/PebbleOS): "Touch is
> reserved for watchapps; watchfaces must not consume it"). Note that
> `touch_service_is_enabled()` still returns true on watchfaces, so don't
> trust it. Accelerometer tap (`accel_tap_service_subscribe`) remains the
> only gesture input available to watchfaces.
