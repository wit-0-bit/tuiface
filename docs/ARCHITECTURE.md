# Architecture Overview

**tuiface** is a Pebble watchface (SDK 3, currently targeting the `emery`
platform / Pebble Time 2, 200x228 px) with a text-forward design: the time and
date sit inside dashed "ASCII window" frames, surrounded by configurable
complication slots and two hardcoded progress-bar sidebars.

This document explains how the pieces fit together. See
[SIDEBARS.md](SIDEBARS.md) for the sidebar-specific design rules.

```

1. The watch requests weather by sending an AppMessage containing
   `WEATHER_TEMP` (`request_weather()` in `messaging.c`) — on launch when the
   persisted cache is stale (`init()` in `main.c`) and at every :00/:30
   minute tick (`update_time()` in `main.c`).
2. The JS side (`index.js`) receives any AppMessage, gets the phone's location,
   and calls two Open-Meteo endpoints: the forecast API (current temperature,
   weather code, and hourly UV — reduced to the peak over the next 12 hours)
   and the air-quality API (US AQI). It maps the
   WMO weather code to a short condition string (`SUN`, `CLD`, `FOG`, `RAIN`,
   `SNOW`, `TSTM`) and sends everything back in one dictionary.
3. `inbox_received_callback()` (`messaging.c`) writes the values into the
   global cache in `data.c`, persists any settings keys, and triggers a redraw.
4. Settings changes made on the Clay config page travel the same AppMessage
   path; the watch persists them with `persist_write_int` and re-reads them on
   the next launch (`init()` in `main.c`).

## C modules (`src/c/`)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `main.c` | App lifecycle: window setup, service subscriptions (tick, battery, bluetooth, health), settings load from persistent storage, text layer creation. |
| `data.c` / `data.h` | Single source of truth for state: sensor/weather caches, settings, the `ComplicationDataSource` enum, slot definitions, and the formatting functions. |
| `theme.c` / `theme.h` | Day/Night `WatchTheme` color palettes, auto theme selection by hour, and per-source color logic (battery level, temperature bands, AQI/UV thresholds). |
| `drawing.c` / `drawing.h` | All custom rendering: the dashed ASCII window frames, sidebar progress bars, the split-color AQI/UV complication, and `refresh_complications()` which pushes formatted text into the slot text layers. |
| `messaging.c` / `messaging.h` | AppMessage in/out: weather requests, inbox parsing, settings persistence. |
| `main.h` | Exposes `update_time()` so messaging can trigger a full refresh. |

### Conventions

- State lives in globals (`s_`-prefixed) declared in `data.h` and defined in
  `data.c`; other modules reference them via `extern`. There is no
  encapsulation layer — this is idiomatic for Pebble's C SDK.
- "No data" sentinels: `-1` for steps/sleep/AQI/UV, `-999` for temperature,
  `0` for heart rate. Formatters render these as `--`.
- Everything that changes state calls `refresh_complications()` and marks the
  canvas layer dirty rather than redrawing directly.

## The complication system

A complication is identified by a `ComplicationDataSource` enum value
(`data.h`). Three functions define each source's behavior:

- `get_source_label()` (`data.c`) — the short title drawn in the window frame
  gap (e.g. `STEP`, `BPM`, `AQI/UV`).
- `get_source_data()` (`data.c`) — formats the value string and optionally a
  0–100 percent (used by sidebars for fill height).
- `get_source_color()` (`theme.c`) — the value's color on color displays
  (e.g. battery green/yellow/red, AQI bands).

There are three placement types:

1. **Slots** — five configurable boxes in `s_complication_slots[]`
   (`data.c`): two wide ones on top (90px), three narrow on the bottom (60px).
   Each slot has a fixed `box_rect`, a `TextLayer`, and a user-chosen source.
   The slot's frame and label are drawn on the canvas
   (`canvas_update_proc`); the value text lives in the slot's text layer,
   updated by `refresh_complications()`. Source `DATA_SOURCE_EMPTY` (20) hides
   a slot entirely.
   - Special case: `DATA_SOURCE_AQI_UV` skips the text layer and is drawn
     directly on the canvas (`draw_aqi_uv_complication`) so AQI and UV can be
     colored independently.
2. **Sidebars** — 4px vertical progress bars on the left/right screen edges,
   hardcoded to Steps (left, fills from top) and Battery (right, fills from
   bottom). Deliberately not configurable; see [SIDEBARS.md](SIDEBARS.md).
3. **Fixed elements** — the time (LECO 60pt) and date (Gothic 18pt) text
   layers inside the TIME and DATE windows.

### Adding a new complication source

1. Add an enum value in `data.h` (before `DATA_SOURCE_EMPTY`, keeping numeric
   values stable — they are persisted and used in `config.json`).
2. Add cases to `get_source_label()` and `get_source_data()` in `data.c`
   (and `get_source_color()` in `theme.c` if it needs color logic).
3. Add the option (label + numeric value as a string) to the relevant `SLOT_*`
   selects in `src/pkjs/config.json`. Top slots are wider — wide formats like
   combined Weather belong only there.
4. If the data comes from the phone, add a message key in `package.json`,
   populate it in `index.js`, and parse it in `inbox_received_callback()`.
5. Add unit tests in `test/test_watchface.c` (formatting, colors, edge cases —
   see AGENTS.md's exhaustive-testing directive).

## Theming

Two `WatchTheme` palettes (`theme.c`): `s_theme_day` (white background) and
`s_theme_night` (black background). The `SETTINGS_THEME` setting selects Day,
Night, or Auto; Auto switches at 6:00 (day) and 18:00 (night) via
`determine_theme()`, re-evaluated every minute because `update_time()` calls
`apply_theme()`. All drawing code reads colors from `s_active_theme`, never
hardcoded colors.

## Rendering

`canvas_update_proc()` (`drawing.c`) draws, in order: the center background,
both sidebars, the TIME and DATE windows, then each non-empty slot's window.
The "ASCII window" look (`draw_ascii_window`) is dashed borders with `+`
crosses at the corners and a gap in the top border where the title is drawn.

Layout constants are hardcoded for emery's 200x228 screen (slot rects in
`data.c`, time/date rects in `main.c` and `drawing.c`). Supporting other
platforms would require deriving these from `layer_get_bounds()`.

## Settings

| Key | Values | Where used |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| `SETTINGS_THEME` | 0 Auto, 1 Day, 2 Night | `determine_theme()` |
| `SETTINGS_UNITS` | 0 Imperial, 1 Metric | Temp formatting/colors; JS picks the API unit, and a unit change triggers an immediate re-fetch |
| `SETTINGS_DATE_FORMAT` | 0 `TUE 2026-06-09`, 1 `2026-06-09 TUE`, 2 `TUE JUNE 9th, 2026` | `format_date_string()` |
| `SLOT_1`–`SLOT_5` | `ComplicationDataSource` value | Slot sources (1=top-left, 2=top-right, 3=bottom-left, 4=bottom-center, 5=bottom-right) |

Clay sends values as strings; `tuple_get_int()` (`data.c`) normalizes string
and integer tuples. On receipt, `inbox_received_callback()` (`messaging.c`)
persists each setting under a dedicated `PERSIST_KEY_*` constant
(`messaging.h`), and `load_settings()` restores them on launch. These persist
keys are hand-assigned and independent of `messageKeys` ordering.

## Testing

Unit tests live in `test/` and run on the host (no emulator needed):

```sh
cd test && make test
```

- `test_watchface.c` `#include`s the C source files directly (so static
  functions are testable) with `TEST_ENV` defined, which compiles out the real
  `main()`.
- `test/pebble.h` + `pebble_mock.c` are a minimal hand-written mock of the
  Pebble SDK — enough types and no-op functions to link the app code.
- The framework is [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity), vendored
  as a git submodule at `test/unity`.
- Coverage focuses on the pure logic: formatters in `data.c`, theme selection,
  and color thresholds. UI code (layers, graphics calls) is linked against
  no-op mocks, not asserted on.

When adding a test, write the `test_*` function and register it with
`RUN_TEST(...)` in `main()` at the bottom of `test_watchface.c`.

## Building & installing

```sh
pebble build                    # uses wscript (standard SDK build)
pebble install --emulator emery
```

`pebble-env/` is a local Python virtualenv for the Pebble tool; `build/` is
generated output. Neither is hand-edited.

## Miscellaneous

- `TODOs.md` tracks approved-but-unbuilt work, `IDEAS.md` holds undecided
  brainstorm material, and `ISSUES.md` tracks known bugs.
- `AGENTS.md` holds the project values, conventions, and hard rules for
  contributors and AI agents.
